Avoiding copies
===============

Cameo users are encouraged to avoid making expensive copies of models (on the order seconds) and other data structures. Instead, we put forward a design pattern based on transactions (see ...)

.. code-block:: python

    from cameo.util import TimeMachine
    with TimeMachine() as tm:
        model.reactions.knock_out(time_machine=tm)
